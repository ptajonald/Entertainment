  <p>ScHoolboy back. Thats a really good album and idk if niggas are talking about it enough. Q redeemed himself after dropping the only bad Black Hippy album with that Crash Talk.</p>
  <p>Im gon get into this Kendrick and Drake beef asap, I just need to gather my thoughts. Really wish I woulda doc'd it in real time but whatever at this point. Shit going crazy though.</p>
  <p>Benny dropped a tape I kinda wanna hear. He fell off around that Hit-Boy album he had but i still respect his pen. Roc Marci new shit cool, need to listen a few more times. Billie coming so I'm expecting some grammy shit outta her. Also Bankreau dropping before the summer which is a very pleasant surprise. Its still Fly Dot U where dreams come true.</p>
