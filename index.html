   <h2>Gaming</h2>
   <p>Playing video games is very more than likely the thing I can do the absolute most without getting tired of it. I could literally play until my hands don't work given the opportunity. Its something about the adventure and the story telling that just does something to me. If I could create a video game that people love, I would be satisfied for life. <span class="games">FF7 Rebirth</span> was nuts. A little winded but overall gameplay was a homerun. So much fun. Shoutout to <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/$0"><span class="playstation">Playstation</span></a> for finally being better than <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/$0"><span class="xbox">Xbox</span></a> for the first time since 6th Gen gaming 20 years ago. Most of my gaming is still done on <span class="xbox">Xbox</span> when I measure number of games played but time spent and number of games that made me feel something has gotta go to <span class="playstation">Playstation</span> for the past maybe 3 years. <span class="games">FF God of War Spiderman Ghosts of Tsushima Horizon Uncharted</span>. I swear <span class="games">Hogwarts Legacy</span> was supposed to be a PS5 exclusive at first but maybe I made that up. Still too many crazy exclusives and I think a few I still havent played. The games I can get on <span class="xbox">Xbox</span> I get on there but it just doesn't feel the same. So I'll do <span class="games">Star Wars Tenkaichi NCAA Assassins Creed TMNT GTA</span> on there and I'm expecting them to go crazy. Hopefully we get <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/switch/$0"><span class="nintendo">Switch 2</span></a> news this year. I've tapped back in to Pokemon and it's been going crazy. Hopefully I'll complete a Pokedex for the first time this year. Couldn't even tell you how long we been waiting for Tenkaichi 4. I dont really rock with fighting games but that's gon read for sure. </p>

   <h2>Cinema</h2>
   <p>With the MCU being almost absent in
    cinema this year, hopefully the other
    studios can pick up the slack.
    <strong>Everything I love gets ruined
     ðŸ˜­.</strong> We'll be seeing a lot
    of sequels but I'm fine with that
    honestly. Dune 2 great. Probably best movie I've seen this year. Godzilla was good too. Planet of the apes movies have yet to disappoint. Deadpool 3 in a couple weeks which is huge and Sonic 3 at the end of year should
    close it off strong. But those damn
    Sony "Spider"-verse movies, oh
    brother do they stink. The first
    Venom was solid but everything since
    then has been God awful. I'll see all
    3 potential stinkers they drop this
    year for the culture but I expect to
    be underwhelmed. 1/3 stamped razzy. I just don't
    understand how they're so bad at
    making movies but they seem pretty
    determined to make bad decisions. A
    Kraven movie where he's not hunting
    Spider-Man? Who tf greenlit that
    bullshit? Madame Web not sitting in
    her life support chair? Why are we
    doing this? Venom 3? After those dumb
    ass post credit scenes? Sure I guess.
    And they have the audacity to argue
    with Feige over the Spider-Man 4
    story. Not that the MCU has been
    competent lately but at least they do
    well with the SP movies. Sony needs
    to just let it go and accept the
    payout from the MCU colabs and bring
    back Garfield as thier Spidey and
    start making sense ASAP. But that Cap4 trailer turnt me up. My niggas bout to restore the feeling. I do think it will take DP3 Cap4 and F4 all being great to completely revitalize the MCU for everybody but Cap4 is the one I'm the most excited about. DP3 I think will be really good because Reynolds is really like that but it will be a lot of fanfare. Hey remember this person? They were a character once remember? That's pretty neat. Gonna be a lot of that which isn't bad but not really moving the overall story forward by just bringing back a bunch of unimportant characters. It will be fun though and the ending I'm sure will be important. That Cap4 bout to be a spy thriller. Its gon set up thunderbolts. Introduce adamantium. Any cameos more likely to advance plot lines. All we're getting from DC
    this year is Joker 2 which will
    probably be jake since it's a musical
    but whatever. I got faith Gunn will
    hit the ground running with the new
    DCU next year. But rumor is, they casted Kumail as Booster Gold and I'm not feeling that one bit. I never see the value in casting minorites as traditionally white characters. I feel like its pandering and unnecessary but whatever I guess.

   <p> TV is really where the MCU started
    to crumble. I mean complete 180 in
    quality and coherence between
    projects. Some is for sure Feiges
    fault but I think one of the biggest
    issues is too many projects being put out
    and curated by random people. Made
    it too hard to keep the stories
    together. Also revealing too many
    projects too early. Telling us about
    movies and shows 5 years in advance and
    meanwhile the path not being clear
    kills the momentum and anticipation.
    We're getting an Agatha Harkness show
    this year for whatever fucking
    reason. Might be entertaining but
    literally don't need that. Xmen 97 was fire but to me that doesn't really help the MCU. And where's the Ironheart show? Young
    Avengers teased so I doubt they
    scrapped it. I could make an entire
    other page about what has went
    wrong but I digress. Curb came back for its final season. RIP Richard Lewis. Tough seeing something so great come to an end. Speaking of funny, we need It's always sunny season 17 in September. The Vince Staples Show came as a very pleasant surprise this year. Vince is just a genius when it comes to entertainment. His ability to seemingly remain true to himself and still entertain in any media he attacks is impressive. The live action Avatar was decent to me. I definitely understand the issues some people had with it. They moved a lot of the story around for no reason honestly but I still enjoyed it. How they pull off Toph in season 2 will be a real test. They also announced Squid Games season 2 but where tf are Umbrella Academy and Stranger Things final seasons? Invincible was good, just too short. I'm a glutton for comic content. The Boys season 4 is almost over and its going great. Hopefully they dont fumble the finale. Same thing for The Acolyte. it started well but I'm not optimistic about the finale today. The show that surprised me the most though, was Fallout. Banger. I don't like the games that much but that show was going crazy. The acting, the writing, the visuals. All fire. </p>

   <p> IDK whos dropping honestly.
    Schoolboy I guess. Dont really have a
    lot of time to listen to music and
    rap
    just aint what it used to be. I hate
    sounding like an old head.</p>
