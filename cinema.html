          <p>Honestly did what it needed to do.
     Pretty much copy and paste and added
     songs. Renee Rapp was great as
     Regina George. They cut out a couple
     jokes like the gym teacher and
     student hooking up which is very
     understandable. Tina fey strikes
     again.</p>

          <p>Watched this on Apple TV+ and it was way better than the streets said it was. IGN was hating giving it a 4 out of 10. Honestly I just think I'm better at managing my expectations for movies. The action was good. Story was solid. I'm only kind of annoyed I still haven't watched the Kingsman movies and the end did reveal Argyle is a part of that universe. Now I really need to watch that series. I watched half of the first one, had togo somewhere and just never went back to it.</p>

          <p>The movie tells nothing about the
     villain other than he wants to kill
     these shorties because he keeps
     dreaming they’re gonna kill him in
     future. Why they’re gonna kill him?
     No clue. But they’re apparently
     gonna destroy him and everything he
     built. What he built? Beats me. How
     he built it? Not important. But he
     does have vague spider powers and a
     pre-spiderman spiderman-style suit
     and I guess can poison people with
     his hands because he stole a spider.
     Whether it bit him or not is
     irrelevant. This nigga seduces an
     NSA agent that obviously has the
     code he needs for their 2003 facial
     recognition software that can find
     anybody anywhere based off his
     description from his dreams aged
     down 10 years by his assistant that
     can somehow use this software
     effortlessly. And I guess he can
     decide if non spider people can see
     him because on the train scene one
     of the girls asked if anybody else
     can see him since nobody is reacting
     to this nigga crawling on the
     fucking ceiling. After that anybody
     can see him. They beat this nigga up
     with fireworks because at no point
     in the movie do any of them get
     their powers.
     
     All the future spiderwomen are
     pseudo orphans so you know heartfelt
     we have something in common scene.
     Early in the movie Ben tells Cassie
     he’s dating someone so she asks him
     her name and he just looks at her
     blank because they obviously have
     some inside joke. Like why do that
     scene if he’s not gonna say May.
     Mary Parker is pregnant so Cassie
     goes to her baby shower even though
     they don’t know each other and they
     play a guess the baby name game and
     no one ever says Peter. Again why?
     Richard Parker is on some business
     trip because mysterious. Peter being
     born in 2003 clearly can’t be
     McGuire Garfield or holland so wtf.
     Cassie gets her clairvoyance powers
     after a near death drowning
     experience. Then falls into the
     ocean again after the final fight
     and becomes blind and paralyzed. I
     guess maybe from fireworks and
     falling sheet metal. After deciding
     she has to protect these girls from
     being hunted she leaves them with
     Ben and goes to the Peruvian jungle
     her mother was killed in and meets
     the spider-people that saved her in
     birth. Dude tells her in the clear
     English he’d been speaking in that
     evil spider guy is cursed because he
     stole a spider that’s actually still
     alive after 30 years. </p>

    What a ride. Can't wait to rewatch. Shoutout to the lisan al-gaib and the whole set. Niggas really was putting on for the hood. Fuck all them Harkonnen niggas they not fucking with my fremen niggas. Seriously a master class in cinema. Zendaya and Timmy were in bag but Austin and Javier stole the show. </p>
